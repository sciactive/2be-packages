Hi #to_name#,<br />
<br />
We've received a request at <a href="#site_link#" target="_blank">#site_link#</a>
to help you recover your account. In case you forgot your username, it's
"#to_username#". You can also reset your password by clicking on the following
link:<br />
<br />
<a href="#recover_link#" target="_blank">#recover_link#</a><br />
<br />
As a safety measure, this link will only work for the next #minutes# minutes. If
you didn't make this request, you can ignore this email.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
