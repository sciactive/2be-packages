================================================================

Pines is an Enterprise PHP Application Framework, including a free **Content
Management System**, **Point of Sale**, **Customer Relation Manager**, and
**much more**. A lot of work, and many all nighters have gone into making Pines
a fantastic framework. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we do!

Pines is available **free of charge** under the terms of the GNU AGPL Version 3.

You can find more information about Pines, including a live demo, at the [Pines
Framework website](http://pinesframework.org/).
