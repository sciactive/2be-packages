WonderPHP is an Enterprise PHP Application Framework, including a free **Content
Management System**, **Point of Sale**, **Customer Relation Manager**, and
**much more**. A lot of work, and many all nighters have gone into making
WonderPHP a fantastic framework. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we do!

WonderPHP is available **free of charge** under the terms of the GNU AGPL
Version 3.

You can find more information about WonderPHP, including a live demo, at the
[WonderPHP website](http://wonderphp.org/).
