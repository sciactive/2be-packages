2be is an Enterprise PHP Application Framework, including a free **Content
Management System**, **Point of Sale**, **Customer Relation Manager**, and
**much more**. A lot of work, and many all nighters have gone into making
2be a fantastic framework. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we do!

2be is available **free of charge** under the terms of the GNU AGPL
Version 3.

You can find more information about 2be, including a live demo, at the
[2be website](http://2be.io/).
